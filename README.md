Tourism Experience Analytics
</h1>

### Project Objective
This project focuses on analysing tourism experience viz user preferences, travel patterns, and attraction features to achieve three primary objectives, regression, classification, and recommendation. 

The goal is to enhance user experiences by leveraging data to provide personalized recommendations, predict user satisfaction, and classify potential user behaviour. 

#### 1. Regression: Predicting Attraction Ratings
Regression model developed to predict the rating a user might give to a tourist attraction based on historical data, user demographics, and attraction features.

#### 2. Classification: User Visit Mode Prediction
Classification model created to predict the mode of visit (e.g., business, family, couples, friends) based on user and attraction data.

#### 3. Tourist attractions Recommendation: 
A recommendation system created to suggest tourist attractions based on a user's historical preferences.

### Technologies used and Pre-requisites

All details and installation information are provided in the Prerquisite.PDF file.

1.	**Python:** The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.

    Visit the URL  [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    to download and install python in the PC

    **Install necessary Python packages / Libraries:** Install the necessary packages / libraries using pip or conda package manager. Required libraries include DateTime, Regex, Streamlit, Pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, etc

2.	**Streamlit:** Streamlit is an open-source Python framework designed to create and share web applications. It is specifically built for Python, making it easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy their models and visualize data without needing extensive knowledge of web development
	
        A web-based user interface is developed using Streamlit where users can choose an predict / recommend options after the initial cleaning and merging of dataset.

### Executing the Application 

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.	Install Python and required packages / libraries as given above
2.	Download the Application Script Jag_Tourism_Proj.py from this Git hub repository.
3.	Launch the Application through Streamlit in the command-line interface.
      **Streamlit run <path>\Jag_Tourism_Proj.py**


### Features

The application offers the following features:
+	Cleansing the datasets and merging them on to one consolidated.csv.
+	Encoding categorical data into numeric / binary, training model and evaluating model performance metrics:
  1.	For classification model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  2.	Regression model using R2, MSE, RMSE, etc
  3.	Recommendation using Mean Average Precision, RMSE

+	Classification model for predicting visit mode based on user demographic and earlier visit details.
+	User rating prediction based on user demographics and tourist attractions inputs.
+	Three types of Recommendation of Attraction spots for users based on users and their interests
+ Data analysis and visualization through charts and graphs using Streamlit's data visualization capabilities.


### Conclusion

This project is a deep dive into the Tourism user Rating, attractions, visit mode and so on. Using Streamlit and various packages available for training, prediction and recommending Classification , regression models, I was able to create an application that provides valuable insights in Tourism industry.
